Phase 1
1) Sales Invoice
Invoice total = T, Net = N, VAT = V

A/R invoice

Dr Accounts Receivable (1120) = T
Cr service Service Revenue (4120)  for service = N or Cr Product sales Revenue(4110 ) for product  = N
Cr Tax Payable (2140) = V (if used)
If inventory + COGS enabled (COGS = C)

Dr COGS (5110) = C
Cr Inventory (1130) = C

2) Customer Payment (applied to invoice)
Payment amount = P

Dr cash and cash equivalent = P (user to select option from cash and cash equivalent)
Cr Accounts Receivable (1120) = P
3) Cash Receipt (not tied to invoice)
 Immediate sale
Dr (cash and cash equivalent) = amount received(customer to select)
Cr service Service Revenue (4120) = N or Cr Product sales Revenue(4110 ) for product  = N
Cr Income Payable (2140) = V (if used)
4) Vendor Bill
Bill total = T, Net = N, VAT = V

A) Expense bill
Dr Expense account(to be selected by customer) = N
Dr Tax Payable (2140) = V (if used)
Cr Accounts Payable (2110) = T

5) Bill Payment (settle A/P)
Payment amount = P

Dr Accounts Payable (2110) = P
Cr (cash and cash equivalent) to be selected by customer  = P

6) Expense (no bill)
Cash/Bank expense
Dr Expense account(to be selected by the customer) = net
Dr Tax Payable (2140) = VAT (if used)
Cr Bank/Cash = total
The cheat sheet (what increases what)
Assets (cash, bank, inventory, AR)
Debit = increase
Credit = decrease
Liabilities (AP, loans, tax payable)
Credit = increase
Debit = decrease
Equity (owner’s capital, retained earnings)
Credit = increase
Debit = decrease
Revenue (sales, service income)
Credit = increase
Debit = decrease (usually refunds/returns or revenue corrections)
Expenses (rent, salaries, fuel, subscriptions)
Debit = increase
Credit = decrease (reversals, reimbursements, corrections)
Quick way to remember:

Debit grows Assets + Expenses
Credit grows Liabilities + Equity + Revenue
How accounting software applies this (real examples)
1) Customer pays you ₦50,000 for a service

Debit Cash/Bank ₦50,000 (Asset ↑)
Credit Revenue ₦50,000 (Revenue ↑)
2) You buy fuel ₦10,000 cash

Debit Fuel Expense ₦10,000 (Expense ↑)
Credit Cash/Bank ₦10,000 (Asset ↓)
3) You buy inventory ₦200,000 on credit (you’ll pay later)

Debit Inventory ₦200,000 (Asset ↑)
Credit Accounts Payable ₦200,000 (Liability ↑)
4) You pay supplier ₦200,000 you owed

Debit Accounts Payable ₦200,000 (Liability ↓)
Credit Cash/Bank ₦200,000 (Asset ↓)
Why this matters in software
Most accounting systems store each transaction as a journal entry with:

lines: account_id, debit_amount, credit_amount
rule: sum(debits) = sum(credits)
account types determine how balances display (and what “normal” is):
Assets/Expenses usually show a debit balance
Liabilities/Equity/Revenue usually show a credit balance

Phase 2 *****
Payroll (accrue + pay)
Let:

Gross = G

Employer contributions/taxes = E
A) Accrue payroll
Dr Wages & Salaries (5100) = G
Cr Payroll Payable (2300) = N

B) Pay employees
Dr Payroll Payable (2300) = N
Cr Bank = N
C) Remit deductions + employer portion
Dr Payroll Taxes Payable (2310) = D
Dr Employer Taxes Payable (2320) = E
Cr Bank = (D + E)

B) Customer deposit / advance

Dr Bank/Cash = deposit
Cr Customer Deposits (2200) = deposit
Later when revenue is earned

Dr Customer Deposits (2200) = applied
